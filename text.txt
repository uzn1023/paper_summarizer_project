Lattice strain eﬀects on the piezoelectric properties of crystalline ferroelectrics have been extensively
studied for decades; however, the strain dependence of the piezoelectric properties at nano-level has
yet to be investigated. Herein, a new overview of the super-strain of nanoporous polycrystalline
ferroelectrics is reported for the ﬁrst time using a nanoengineered barium calcium zirconium titanate
composition (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 (BCZT). Atomic-level investigations show that the controlled pore
wall thickness contributes to highly strained lattice structures that also retain the crystal size at the
optimal value (<30 nm), which is the primary contributor to high piezoelectricity. The strain ﬁeld derived
from geometric phase analysis at the atomic level and aberration-corrected high-resolution scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) yields of over 30% clearly show theoretical agreement with
high piezoelectric properties. The uniqueness of this work is the simplicity of the synthesis; moreover the
piezoresponse d33 becomes giant, at around 7500 pm V−1. This response is an order of magnitude
greater than that of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), which is known to be the most successful ferroelectric
over the past 50 years. This concept utilizing nanoporous BCZT will be highly useful for a promising
high-density electrolyte-free dielectric capacitor and generator for energy harvesting in the future.
Introduction
Piezoelectric materials have been widely used in sensors,
transducers, undersea sonar, and small devices for medical
diagnostic applications. Researchers have not previously deeply
examined the possibility of energy harvesting using piezoelec-
tric devices as a rival to large-scale traditional energy sources,
such as coal, hydrocarbons, and other known sources.1 The key
component in the design of piezoelectric generators is the use
of highly eﬃcient, stable, environmentally friendly, and low-
cost piezoelectric materials that can respond eﬀectively to
applied mechanical stress that distorts the crystal structure and
electric voltage generation. The most rigorous work has been
done on lead zirconate and lead titanate, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT), with
various doping of a variety of composites, with a high piezo-
electric charge constant (d33) (650 pC N−1) and electrome-
chanical
coupling
coeﬃcient
(k33)
(0.78),
in
a
direction
longitudinal to the applied stress.2 For half a century, the PZT
ceramic family has been representative of a large class of
technologically important materials—that is, piezoelectrics—
that convert mechanical stress (strain) and electrical voltage
(charge), representing the piezoelectric eﬀect and the inverse
piezoelectric eﬀect.3 The highest d33 (∼2500 pC N−1) and k33
(>0.9)4 have been reported in prototypes of Pb-based relaxors,
Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3
(PMN-PT)
and
Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-
PbTiO3 (PZN-PT), which are only in the form of a single crystal.5

These highly toxic lead-based materials are commercially
dominant piezoelectric materials. However, researchers world-
wide have been searching for lead-free piezoelectric materials
for more than a decade, aiming to replace these toxic materials.6
This goal—that is, the invention of a Pb-free piezoelectric
material with a performance equivalent to or even superior to
that of PZT-based piezoelectric materials—has not yet been
fullled. In recent years, barium titanate (BaTiO3, BTO),7
bismuth sodium titanate (Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3, NBT),8 potassium
sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO),9 and bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3)10
have been widely studied as Pb-free sustainable materials. In
particular, BTO has shown potential for use in piezoelectric
applications, such as multilayer ceramic capacitors, as it has
a high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss.11 However, the
values of d33 (191 pC N−1) and k33 (0.494) in BTO12 are still far
behind
those
of
its
commercially
available
Pb-based
counterparts.
Consequently, researchers worldwide have attempted to
improve the performance of BTO. Cao et al. reported that
a reduction in the grain size to 1.6 mm is responsible for
enhancing d33 to a value as high as 460 pC N−1.13 More recently,
Wada et al. synthesized grain-oriented ceramics of BTO by the
templated grain growth (TGG) method, obtaining a remarkable
d33 value of 788 pC N−1.14 However, the TGG method requires
complex remixing and recalcination of spherical and ake-
structured presynthesized BTO in diﬀerent ratios. This gives
the desired planar orientation (111)—where the dipole rotation
happens to be in its least energy-invasive state to transfer
surface charge, resulting in the best piezoelectric response. In
another report, a seed-passivated texturing process was utilized
to fabricate textured PZT ceramics through microplatelet tem-
plating.15 Though this strategy achieved a piezoelectric coeﬃ-
cient d33 of 760 pC N−1, it involves multi-step preparation. By
considering all these complex and extended synthesis methods,
a simple synthesis approach with a very high yield is required to
prepare a new BTO candidate that is highly competitive with
commercially available Pb-based materials.
Many eﬀorts to dope BTO with diﬀerent elements have
demonstrated its potential to compete with commercially
available PZT. A calcium and zirconium co-doped barium tita-
nate system (Ba(Ti0.8Zr0.2)O3-(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3, BZT-BCT) with
a noticeably enhanced d33 (∼620 pC N−1) was also reported by
Liu et al.16 The orthorhombic Ba0.85Ca0.15(Ti0.9 Zr0.1)O3 (BCZT)
in its morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) is thermodynami-
cally unstable in a ferroelectric phase, with polarization rotation
occurring within the minimum energy state in the crystal
system, and it can be easily manipulated by external stress or an
electric eld with minimum eﬀort, yielding the best ferroelec-
tric properties. In addition, according to some earlier publica-
tions on BCZT polycrystalline ceramics, the coexistence of
polymorphic phase transitions can play a signicant role in
enhancing the dielectric and piezoelectric properties.16–18 The
variations in the composition of Ca (14–18 mol%) trigger the
polymorphic phase (the coexistence of orthorhombic-tetragonal
phases), tending toward ferroelectric relaxor behavior. Conse-
quently, a wide range of piezoelectric and ferroelectric proper-
ties can be tailored in such novel single BCZT structural models
by simply varying their stoichiometry. The highest dielectric
constant 3r (5000) has been reported in bulk BCZT by varying the
Ca content between 12 and 16 mol%.19 As another strategy, our
previous study on nanoporous lms hinted that the existence of
elongated nanopores certainly leads to a successful strain
engineering process for enhancing piezoelectricity. Meanwhile,
the improved surface area enhances the dipole moment at the
surface, thereby enhancing the piezoelectric response.20
Hence, we prepared highly strained nanoporous Ba0.85-
Ca0.15(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3 (BCZT) by a so-templating method and we
investigated the strain pattern developed in the BCZT lm. We
also studied the atomic-scale strain mapping using high-
resolution electron microscopy and analyzed it by using the
presence of strong Bragg reections in its Fourier transform. In
principle, strain and local deformation can be determined
directly by measuring the displacement of the lattice fringes on
the atomic scale. The technique of quantitative measurement of
such displacement and strain eld analysis in this study is
based upon a theoretical method developed by M. J. Hytch,2,9
regarded as geometric phase analysis. Piezoresponse force
microscopy (PFM) study is also popular for conrming piezo-
electricity in the nano-regime and to calculate the piezoelectric
coeﬃcient (d33).11,21 The PFM study in this work gathers an
accurate vertical piezoresponse (d33) mapping, a hysteresis-
buttery loop for quantitative analysis. It is found that the ob-
tained d33 and strain values in the synthesized nanoporous
BCZT are in good agreement and indicate ten-fold higher d33
compared to its non-porous bulk counterpart. Such a nano-
porous lm shows great promise for high-density energy
harvesting.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of nanoporous BCZT lm and observation of porous
structure
Nanoporous BCZT lms were synthesized by a sol–gel-based
method using a diblock copolymer (PS-b-PEO) as a pore-
directing agent. The role of PS-b-PEO as a pore-directing agent
was demonstrated in our previous report.22 In the precursor
solution, the PS-b-PEO polymers form spherical micelles (i.e.,
a template) where the PS blocks are the core and the PEO blocks
are the shell. The resulting nanoporous BCZT presents both
highly crystallized and amorphous/poorly crystallized phases,
as evidenced by the diﬀerent morphologies (light and dark) in
the SEM image (Fig. 1a). The growth architecture of the pores on
the top of the lm surface calcined at 650 °C is elongated due to
the framework crystallization, which is further veried by the
STEM image (Fig. 1b). The coexistence of two phases is also
further conrmed by the diﬀerence in stiﬀness in the phase
images from atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 1c and d).19
The boundary between the two phases is clearly separated by
the dotted line marked in the topographical image in Fig. 1c.
The diﬀerence in contrast is evident in the region with high
contrast as a highly crystalline region, whereas low contrast
indicates the amorphous/poorly crystalline region. Without the
use of a pore-directing agent, the bulk BCZT (calcined at 700 °C)

possesses random grains of several tens of nanometers in size
(Fig. S1a†).
On the other hand, with the use of PS-b-PEO, nanopores start
to form aer calcination at 400 °C due to the removal of the
template (Fig. S2a†). The nanopores become large by joining
with their neighbouring pores and are elongated as the calci-
nation temperature increases (Fig. S2b†). Crystallinity can
hardly be observed in the lms calcined at 400 °C and 500 °C
(Fig. S2c†). Abundant robust nanopores with highly crystallized
frameworks can obviously be observed at 650 °C (Fig. S1b, c and
S2c†). The expansion and partial collapse of the nanopores
occurs in a temperature range higher than 650 °C. Therefore,
650 °C is xed as the optimized temperature. From the above
results, it is found that the resulting nanoporous architecture
shows a very diﬀerent morphology from the BCZT bulk lm (it
should be noted that we attempted to synthesize a bulk lm
without PS-b-PEO at a calcination temperature of 650 °C, but no
signicant XRD peaks were found, indicating amorphous BCZT;
therefore, the calcination temperature was increased to 700 °C
(Fig. S1c†).
As shown in Fig. S1c,† both bulk and nanoporous BCZT lms
show a perovskite phase. In the case of the BCZT bulk lm,
some peaks other than those of BCZT (i.e., impurities) are
observed in the low-angle region. However, the addition of PS-b-
PEO can facilitate a homogeneous mixing of inorganic sources
without precipitation, thereby forming an almost pure BCZT
phase. The average crystallite sizes of the bulk and nanoporous
BCZT roughly calculated from the Scherrer equation are ca.
10 nm and 23 nm, respectively. It is interesting that nanoporous
BCZT becomes more crystallized with the addition of a so
template, and the calculated crystallite size is smaller than the
thickness of the pore walls (Fig. 1b).
Atomic distribution in nanoporous BCZT lm
The ADF-STEM image and EDS mappings for nanoporous
BCZT are shown in Fig. 2. The low-magnication ADF-STEM
image shows that this sample is a collection of crystal grains
of less than 100 nm. A high-resolution ADF-STEM image of the
grains shows low-index crystal band axes ([100] or [001]). It can
be deduced that the strong-intensity columns are Ba and the
weak ones are Ti, since this is an ADF-STEM image, in which
the intensity is approximately proportional to the square of
the elemental number. The EDS mappings are obtained from
the same area as the ADF-STEM images. Since the Ba and Ti
peaks appear at almost the same energy position in the EDS
spectra (Fig. S3†), they are also almost identical in the map.

Therefore, the columns of Ba and Ti cannot be distinguished
from the EDS mapping. However, it can be said that the
previous assumption of Ba in the intense column and Ti in the
less intense column is correct by combining the ADF-STEM
and EDS results. Additionally, the substitution positions for
Ca and Zr can be estimated by comparing the high-resolution
ADF-STEM images and the EDS mappings. It is diﬃcult to
identify the positions of Ca and Zr due to their weak intensity.
Therefore, image processing is performed to enhance the
visibility of each position. These images are superimposed on
the high-resolution ADF-STEM images. The results show that
Ca and Zr are substituted for Ba and Ti. These mapping
images are direct evidence of the successful doping of Ca and
Zr atoms. The Ba, Ca, Ti, and Zr compositional ratio coincides
with the ICP result, supporting the formation of Ba0.85-
Ca0.15(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O3. The ADF-STEM images for nanoporous
BTO are shown in Fig. S4.† The details of the doping levels are
evaluated from XPS (Fig. S5†).
Measurement in PFM analysis
Quantitative studies of piezoelectric behavior and polarization-
related properties at the nanoscale can be challenging and
extremely sensitive to the experimental conditions of piezores-
ponse force microscopy (PFM). However, near-accurate results
can be achieved by carefully optimizing several factors. These
include (i) electrostatic contributions due to cantilever-surface
nonlocal and tip-surface local capacitive forces, (ii) tip bias to
calibrate and compensate for linear dielectric contributions,
and (iii) choice of driving voltage (VAC) and bias window of
measurement.23 In the measurement process, the electrostatic
contribution can be represented by the equation: Ael = G(u)(VDC
−Vsurf), where Ael represents the electrostatic contribution, G(u)
denotes the frequency-dependent electromechanical response
function, VDC is the direct current voltage, and Vsurf represents
the surface potential. Unlike the piezoelectric contribution to
the signal, which remains independent of the tip bias for linear
piezoelectric
or
dielectric
components,

contribution varies linearly with bias and becomes zero when
the null condition VDC = Vsurf is met. This null condition can be
identied by carefully assessing the uniformity of the grayscale
contribution in the amplitude image in PFM. In an unoptimized
image, surface charge (non-piezoresponse components) may
appear as very bright contrasts (white highlights). The pro-
portionality factor G(u) is strongly dependent on frequency and
can signicantly amplify the contribution to the PFM signal,
particularly at frequencies near 300 kHz.24
A heavily doped (conductive)-silicon cantilever was used with
a spring constant of 2.7 N m−1 and medium stiﬀness with high
contact resonance, and fairly tight adhesion to the sample
surface (essential for compensating for local capacitive forces)
by the cantilever was found to be best suited for all studied
materials including the reference sample. A contact resonance
of 200–300 kHz was present in the studied sample during
scanning. A test reference sample of PZT lm (the same lm
thickness as the studied sample) with known d33 was taken for
which the contact resonance lay within the same frequency
range and the VAC modulation window of the cantilever was
tuned to resemble the known piezoresponse (d33) of PZT to
compensate for the proportionality factor G(u) due to any
frequency artefact that may have occurred. 1 V was found to be
stable and was kept constant in all studied samples since all the
samples were fairly responsive below this threshold. Therefore,
sample deformation becomes Aout-plane = d33 at 1 V (ref. 11) and
the amplitude image of PFM becomes a direct representation of
the vertical piezoresponse (d33), as shown by the plotted data in
Fig. 3. Generally, the unit for d33 is C N−1 or m V−1.
Piezoresponse and strain in nanoporous BCZT lm
The mapping of piezoresponse, representing vertical ampli-
tudes with respect to the lm substrate, is illustrated in Fig. 3.
The amplitudes for the bulk (Fig. 3a) and nanoporous lms
(Fig. 3b) go from 0 to 600 pm V−1 and from 4.5 to 7.5 nm V−1,
respectively. Therefore, approximately 10 times the amplitude is
observed for nanoporous BCZT compared to that of the bulk.
The maximum amplitude for the bulk lm is 600 pm and that
for the nanoporous lm is 7.5 nm. These results are reected in
the d33 values at 1 V in the amplitude–voltage loops, which will
be discussed later. This is because the amplitude in Fig. 3
indirectly means d33, as a voltage of 1 VAC is applied in the PFM
experiment. Surprisingly, the result is that this large remnant
d33 value of nanoporous BCZT far exceeds those of other Pb-
based materials.2,4,7–10,12–16 The strain is calculated with high-
resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-
STEM) (Hitachi HF5000 aberration-corrected STEM). A Bragg-
ltered image of the lattice strain is calculated using the FFT
patterns (see details in the ESI;† the validity of strain values and
Fig. S6†). Fig. 4 shows the strain eld images for bulk and
nanoporous BCZT lms.
Surprisingly, there is a large diﬀerence in the calculated
strain distribution between bulk and nanoporous BCZT lms.
The values are $0.3% and over ∼30% for bulk and nanoporous
BCZT lms, respectively. The strain for the nanoporous BCZT
lm is approximately 100 times larger than that of bulk BCZT
lm. The mathematical relationship between strain (obtained
quantitatively from geometric phase analysis; Fig. 4) and pie-
zoresponse (obtained from PFM; Fig. 5) shows they are directly
related where our quantitative ndings satisfy the bounded
relation equation, as follows:
3 = d33EG(u)−1,
where 3 is strain, d33 is the vertical piezoresponse, E is the
coercive eld, G(u)−1 is a proportionality factor calibrated for an
optical beam deection sensor (OBD) equipped with a DART
PFM, provided by the PFM manufacturer Oxford Instruments,
USA and given in the ESI† (Fig. S6).
Piezoresponse in nanoporous BCZT lm

iterations, which correspond to four sets of data obtained
during nano-indentation probing at the same location. This
approach allows for an extended duration of “polling” under the
applied electric eld compared to a single probing or iteration.
Also, it ensures the repeatability and quality of the collected
data. The relationship between deection and voltage for bulk

(non-porous) and nanoporous BCZT is depicted by deection–
voltage hysteresis loops (Fig. 5a and d). The amplitude values
for the nanoporous BCZT lm are approximately ten times
larger (7500 pm V−1 vs. 550 pm V−1) than those for the bulk
BCZT lm (Fig. 5c and f). In the case of the nanoporous BCZT
lm, the coercive voltage Vc at the cross-point of the loop is
approximately ±50 V, which is indicative of a larger internal
strain (since the strain is directly proportional to d33) compared
to the bulk BCZT lm (Fig. 5f). Meanwhile, the relationship
between phase and voltage for nanoporous BCZT is depicted by
rectangular loops with a squareness ratio near unity, which are
absent in non-porous BCZT (Fig. 5b and e) due to the high
energy content possessed by nanoporous BCZT. 180° phase ips
are observed for both nanoporous and bulk lms (Fig. 5b and e).
The d33–voltage hysteresis loops, which are ferroelectric polar-
ization–electric eld-like hysteresis loops, can be observed
(Fig. 5c and f). The remnant d33 value is 7500 pm V−1 (Fig. 5f).
This value of remnant d33 is more than 10 times larger than that
for the bulk BCZT lm and for the previously reported BZT-
BCT.15 Compared to those of non-doped BTO and PZT, i.e.,
representative Pb-based materials, the value of d33 for nano-
porous BCZT is much larger.2,12 Furthermore, the obtained
value in this study is demonstrated to be reasonable according
to 3r (Fig. S7†). The large dielectric constant (3r = 1500 and 1000
for nanoporous and BCZT, respectively) and adequately low
leakage current density (J = 10−6 A cm−2 for nanoporous BCZT
in comparison to 10−7 A cm−2 for bulk BCZT) for practical use
are conrmed in both nanoporous and bulk lms (Fig. S8†).
Moreover, the dielectric loss tan d values for both nanoporous
and bulk lms are almost the same at approximately 0.03 to
0.04 in the frequency range from 0.001 to 0.01 MHz, whereas
they show an increase above 0.01 MHz (Fig. S7†). In addition,
the tan d value for the nanoporous BCZT lm shows a more
gradual increase than that for the bulk BCZT lm. It is
approximately 0.12 at 1 MHz, which is approximately half that
for the bulk lm. Therefore, higher 3r and lower tan d for the
nanoporous lm than for the bulk lm are observed over this
frequency range. In these measurements, the piezoresponse is
not symmetrical along the vertical axes, indicating a strain
memory eﬀect. This eﬀect is microscopically attributed to
domain switching in non-180° domains which was previously
reported in PZT.25 Additionally, the values of the coercive volt-
ages of Vc−and Vc+ are not the same in the d33–voltage hysteresis
loops, which indicates the existence of an internal bias voltage.
The calculated values of Vc−and Vc+ in the d33–voltage hysteresis
loops for bulk BCZT are y−3.5 V and y8.2 V, respectively
(Fig. 5c), while for nanoporous BCZT they are y−62.8 V and
y57.5 V, respectively (Fig. 5f). Such asymmetry is remarkable in
the deection–voltage hysteresis loop (Fig. 5a and d). Two
distinct values are observed at 0 V, indicating a signicant
internal bias voltage. This is due to the oﬀset voltage being
applied by the doping and porous structure. The coercive eld,
Vc (Fig. 5f), is notably ve times higher than that of its bulk
counterpart (Fig. 5c). Additionally, the energy generation
equation,
E ¼ 1
2 CVc
2,
highlights
the
signicance
of
the
“square” term of Vc, serving as another breakthrough indicator
for mainstream energy harvesters, alongside the discovery of
the massive d33. Such a phenomenon is not observed in bulk
BCZT materials.
Conclusions
We have investigated the piezoelectric properties of a nano-
porous BCZT lm with articially engineered strains at the
nanoscale using a so-templating approach. Deformation ari-
ses from the pore wall structure, leading to strain veried
through geometric phase analysis. As is evident from the PFM
measurements, the d33 of nanoporous BCZT is 10 times greater
than that of bulk BCZT. The introduction of the porous struc-
ture causes strong anisotropic stress on the oxygen octahedron
in the BCZT crystal, which signicantly distorts the crystal
lattice. As a result, spontaneous polarization occurs in a partic-
ular orientation, which is thought to have resulted in large
piezoelectricity. Our nanoporous BCZT lm demonstrates
signicant piezoelectricity solely through the introduction of
a nanoporous structure, eliminating the necessity for creating
intricate architectures, such as nanowires, nanobers, or
nanocore/shell structures.26–28 This study introduces a new
approach for the cost-eﬀective production of Pb-free piezoelec-
tric materials using much lower annealing temperatures while
achieving an ultra-high piezoresponse, d33. Furthermore, it
opens up a new avenue for high-density energy harvesting
applications, serving as a renewable alternative to fossil fuels—
an aspect that has not previously been explored.
